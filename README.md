# EV-Range-Forecasting-using-GEN-AI-AND-ML

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Electric Vehicle (EV) drivers and fleet managers need accurate, real-time estimates of remaining driving range under varying conditions (battery aging, temperature, payload, driving style, route elevation, traffic). Traditional heuristic-based or static models often mis-estimate range when conditions change. This project builds a data-driven pipeline that uses supervised ML models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) to predict remaining range from telematics and environmental features, and augments the solution with generative-AI components (e.g., to synthesize realistic telemetry for rare conditions, to produce natural-language explanations for predictions, or to power a conversational assistant for drivers and operators). The objective is an end-to-end system for training, evaluation, inference and a small UI/CLI demonstrating predictions + human-friendly explanations.
